# Unsupervised Learning Final Project

University project on unsupervised learning. The project consists of an anomaly detection task on a custom dataset provided by the instructors.

The tasks to complete are:

    1. Implement a custom function to compute the distance between data points by addressing different types of data (binary, categorical, continuous)
    2. Perform anomaly detection by using a variety of different algorithms
